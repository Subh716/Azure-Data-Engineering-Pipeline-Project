# Azure-Data-Engineering-Pipeline-Project
Data Pipeline for Olist Brazilian E-commerce Dataset using Azure Ecosystem like Azure Data Factory, Azure Databricks, ADLS Gen2, Azure Synapse Analytics, SQL, MongoDB, PySpark, Medallion Architecture
Azure Data Engineering Project – E-Commerce Analytics Pipeline

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a **scalable data engineering solution** using Microsoft Azure services to ingest, transform, and serve e-commerce data for analytics and business intelligence. It simulates real-world business data across **orders, customers, product catalogs, reviews, sales, and logistics**, applying **medallion architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold)** for efficient processing and downstream consumption.

The final output powers real-time dashboards via **Power BI** using **Azure Synapse Analytics** as the serving layer.

##  How to Run

> **Prerequisites:**
> - Azure Resource Group
> - Azure SQL Database and MongoDB with sample data
> - Azure Data Factory, Azure Databricks, Synapse, and ADLS Gen2 configured

### 1. Deploy Resources
- Create resource group, ADLS Gen2, ADF, Databricks, and Synapse workspace.
- Load sample data into SQL DB and MongoDB.

### 2. Ingest Data
- Use **ADF pipelines** for both batch and real-time ingestion.
- Store raw data in the **Bronze layer** of ADLS Gen2.

### 3. Data Transformation
- Run **PySpark notebooks in Databricks** to clean, join, and enrich data.
- Move cleaned data to **Silver**, and aggregated/enriched to **Gold** layer.

### 4. Serve Data
- Use **Azure Synapse CETAS** to create external tables from the **Gold** layer.
- Connect Synapse to Power BI to create reports and dashboards.

## Tech Stack: Azure | PySpark | Synapse | Power BI | MongoDB | SQL


### Outcome
Solves the challenge the streamlined of integrating and processing large volumes of e-commerce data from multiple sources (SQL, MongoDB) into a unified, analytics-ready format. It enables real-time and batch processing through a scalable Azure-based pipeline using ADF, Databricks, and Synapse. The solution improves data accessibility, reduces reporting latency by 50%, and boosts analytics performance by 40%, supporting timely business decision-making.
